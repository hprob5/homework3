## Task 1
### part a
Here we don't use read_csv specifically because the delimiter is not a comma.
```{r}
data = read_csv2('data/data.txt') 
data
```

### part b
```{r}
data2 = read_delim('data/data2.txt', delim = "6", col_names = TRUE, col_types = c("f","d","c"))
data2
```


## Task 2
### part a
```{r}
trailblazer <- read_csv("data/trailblazer.csv")
head(trailblazer)
```

### part b
```{r}
trailblazer_longer = trailblazer |> pivot_longer(cols = 2:11, names_to = c('Game', 'Location'), names_sep = "_", values_to = 'Points')
head(trailblazer_longer, n=5)
```

### part c
use pivot_wider to reshape the trailblazer_longer data frame such that you have a 90 x 4
tibble with columns Player, Game, Home, Away,
```{r}

```
